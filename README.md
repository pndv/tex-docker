# Docker for XeLaTeX on Fedora based on TexLive

Fedora based image for TexLive distribution. This is a non-hardened image, which means it is possible to inherit the
image for development, add/remove and modify programs as needed.

Contrast it to the official TeXLive, which removes the installation lists and makes it very difficult to further modify
the image.
